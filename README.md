### Hi there 👋🏼

I am a Senior Software Engineer at Pluralsight. 
I love to learn, collaborate, and help others.
You can find me in the mountains 🥾🚵⛷️.

Before landing my job at Pluralsight, I experienced being a developer in many domains including finance, education, and health.
Although most of my professional experience is in .NET, I enjoy learning any tech.
