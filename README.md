### Hi there 👋🏼

I am a Platform Engineer at Pluralsight. 
I love to learn, collaborate, and help others.
You can find me nearly every weekend in the mountains either hiking or skiing.

Before landing my dream job at Pluralsight, I experienced being a developer in many domains including finance, education, and health.
Although most of my professional experience is in .NET, I enjoy learning any tech.
